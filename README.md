My website is a short pubquiz (with only two questions). The main file is index.html, which includes the actual text that can be seen if you open the website.
If you answer a question wrong, you will be forwarded to another website, linked to wrong_answer.html. This website shows you a picture and a link back to the original site.
The same principle is used for getting a question right (linked to correct_answer.html and good_answer.html).
In style.css and style.scss you will find style properties that are linked to my main index.html file.
My website isn't a beauty, but it works :)!
